1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your Python project is located. For example, you can use the cd command to change directories: cd path/to/project

3. Once you are in the project directory, create a new virtual environment using the python -m venv command followed by the name you want to give your environment. For example, to create an environment named myenv, you can use the following command: python -m venv myenv

4. Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:
  Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
  Linux or macOS: source myenv/bin/activate
    When the virtual environment is activated, you should see the name of the environment in your command prompt or terminal.

5. Install the packages listed in your requirements.txt file using the pip install command followed by the file path to the requirements.txt file. For example, if your requirements.txt file is located in the project directory, you can use the following command: 
  pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Wait for the installation to complete. This will install all the packages listed in your requirements.txt file into your virtual environment.

7. Once the installation is complete, you can use the packages in your Python code.

8. To exit the virtual environment, you can use the deactivate command.
